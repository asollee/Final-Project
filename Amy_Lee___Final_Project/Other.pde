Have all the rooms in Other class as methods, 
and then in main call each method according to the room..?

BUT THEN, have to have functions inside functions because need to create 
inside each room

room = method
objects and parts of room in each method..?

- slaughterhouse room / kitchen (blue/gray/black tint to room; dirty with dirt, blood,
feathers, dust; workbench style table with chicken and knife, when clicked the knife
decapitates the chicken; faint, blue and orange fire at stove; giant carved cow 
carcass on right side, swings and twirls slightly when clicked); 
- dining room (dark mad tea party from Alice in Wonderland; dark with few candles 
that flicker; long dining table with white sheetcloth stretches forever into the screen; 
plates and silver ware; big, whole pig in the center, head can be removed with mouse 
by dragging and behind the head can "see" into carcass?)
- bed room (four or five metal, jail beds, can uncover the sheets with a click and find
objects in each bed (knife, dirty teddy bear, old photograph, key, etc.); stone floors
like a jail cell; dirty and cracked windows like in joke mv)
- asylum room / art room (use inspiration and instrumental audio from MAMA; script/words will be 
layered with other layers of artworks and words; neon/high contrast color palette; 
have animation match to song if possible? like in the video; paint dripping down the
paintings and walls)
- bathroom (blue/gray tint, cold vibes, whole room underwater/filled with water 
with pills streaking down; the pill container will be on its side as if pills spilled)
- mirror room (utilizing video, that becomes the texture for every surface in the room;
dark with cracks on mirror/video; some static; is immediate image editing possible when
using cameras?; filter = inverse colors, high contrast, dark, grainy)
- clock room / study room (use audio to get multiple clocks to tick at once; room is 
almost round as if in fish eye lens to make it feel like user is in actual clock; 
enlargened images of clocks all around, some with hands moving or spinning crazily
that stop in their tracks with a mouse click; ALSO with mousepress = no audio)
- attic (single skeleton in center; different parts of the body moves when clicked, 
eyehole in skull light up, fingers twiddle on one hand, other hand makes a fist, 
ribs expand slightly as if emulating breathing, feet twitch/move; single, faint/subtle
spotlight on skeleton; no more dustmotes, everything else is black with only faint depth
to indicate a room)
